## Introduction


In this lab, you will be building a ListView that shows your collection of books (using Book objects). Complete all of the TODO items marked in the starter code.

The user should be able to mark a book as read when they are done. When you click on a book in the list, the text color should change to red.

**Hint:** You can use android.R.layout.simple_list_item_2 to display text.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Make an activity that contains a ListView which displays the book title and author
- Complete the BaseAdapter to display the book information
- Clicking a Book title changes the text to red

**Bonus:**

- Allow the user to sort books by title and author
